### Q3: Please explain the abstract classes, general etc. In more detail with examples.
First thing first, abstract class and abstraction ( an OOP pillar ) are two different things. An obstract class is like an interface which can have only declaration of method , for both we can't create the instance but the difference is, abstract class can have method implementation as well.

Please raise this tomorrow in class, will discuss that again with examples.

String.IndexOf(char x, int start1)
String.IndexOf(char x, int start1, int start2)
String.IndexOf(string s1)
String.IndexOf(string s1, int start1)
String.IndexOf(string s1, int start1, int start2)
String.IndexOf(string s1, int start1, int start2, StringComparison cType)
String.IndexOf(string s1, int start1, StringComparison cType)
String.IndexOf(string s1, StringComparison cType)
